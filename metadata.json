  "description": "Dexi Applications Menu is mainly based on Gno-Menu, but with many bug fixes and UI improvements. These two share the same features, you can safely replace Gno-Menu with Dexi Menu if you like this one better.

Bug fixes:
* Enabling this extension will no longer cause applications' panel icon to be a little larger

UI improvements:
* No dividers here and there
* Categories and Places are divided by space
* Power menu and User menu are merged into one
* New applications' description and title display
* Total size higher, you need not to scroll Categories or Places now

For those who want to take a look at Gno-Menu: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/608/gnomenu/",
